## Finding a doctor
Finding a doctor who knows what PEP is to get that prescription can be tough. We combine information from different sources
and display LGBT-friendly doctors in your area. Simply select the default Doctors tab in the top switch-bar.

## Finding a pharmacy
Finding a pharmacy that carries PEP can be difficult. Using Pepr you can easily sift through the ones that do not carry
what you need when you select on the Pharmacies tab.

## Get a donation-based ride there!
We have partnered up with [Homobiles](http://homobiles.org), a non-profit organization that is dedicated to providing secure
and reliable transit to the LGBTQIA community. They offer there services on a sliding-scale, donation basis. Whenever Pepr
is used in a Promise Zone, a Rideshare icon will appear in the bottom right. From there a Homobiles ride can be request.
